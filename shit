Same as the sh used when downloading .sh URLs

But using IPFS

shit stands for "sh it", but honestly the objective is the fun name (despite paradoxically it was made focused on IPFS)
Purpose: tell how shitty it is to install a .sh script directly from a URL you found somewhere

`shit <URL.sh>`
```bash
wget $2 /tmp/shit.sh
sh /tmp/./shit.sh
```
